\title*{Role Models: Role-based Debloating for Web Applications}

\subsection*{Abstract}
The process of debloating, i.e., removing unnecessary code and features in software, has become an attractive proposition to managing the ever-expanding attack surface of ever-growing modern applications. Researchers have shown that debloating produces significant security improvements in a variety of application domains including operating systems, libraries, compiled software, and, more recently, web applications. Even though the client/server nature of web applications allows the same backend to serve thousands of users with diverse needs, web applications have been approached monolithically by existing debloating approaches. That is, a feature can be debloated only if none of the users of a web application requires it. Similarly, everyone gets access to the same ``global'' features, whether they need them or not.

Recognizing that different users need access to different features, in this paper we propose role-based debloating for web applications. In this approach, we focus on clustering users with similar usage behavior together and providing them with a custom debloated application that is tailored to their needs. Through a user study with 60 experienced web developers and administrators, we first establish that different users indeed use web applications differently. This data is then used by \sys{}, an automated pipeline for providing tailored debloating based on a user's true requirements. Next to debloating web applications, \sys{} includes a transparent content-delivery mechanism that routes authenticated users to their debloated copies. 
We empirically demonstrate that \sys{} can be 30-80\% more effective than the state-of-the-art in debloating in removing critical vulnerabilities.
