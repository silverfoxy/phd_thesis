\section{Availability}

The main purpose of our work is to quantify the security benefits of
debloating web applications, allowing the community to have informed
discussions about the advantages of debloating, without the need of vague
references to attack-surface reduction. To ensure the repeatability of our findings and to motivate more research
in this area, \emph{all} developed code and data artifacts are publicly available at: \url{https://debloating.com}.
