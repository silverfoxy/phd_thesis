However,$\backslash$nspecialization has not been broadly applied beyond the$\backslash$nresearch community because current techniques based on$\backslash$nmanual specialization, are time-consuming and$\backslash$nerror-prone. The goal of the work described in this$\backslash$npaper is to help operating system tuners perform$\backslash$nspecialization more easily. We have built a$\backslash$nspecialization toolkit that assists the major tasks of$\backslash$nspecializing operating systems. We demonstrate the$\backslash$neffectiveness of the toolkit by applying it to three$\backslash$ndiverse operating system components. We show that using$\backslash$ntools to assist specialization enables significant$\backslash$nperformance optimizations without error-prone manual$\backslash$nmodifications. Our experience with the toolkit suggests$\backslash$nnew ways of designing systems that combine high$\backslash$nperformance and clean structure.},

	abstract     = {Feature creep has emerged as a serious threat due to the growing number of utilities and capabilities crammed into modern software systems. While feature elimination and de-bloating techniques can produce slimmer executables, a complete elimination of all unnecessary or unwanted features is often not possible, not only due to the tight coupling of feature-related functions/codes, but also because the usefulness/necessity of program features is often difficult to determine statically and can vary during runtime. This paper presents DamGate, a framework for dynamic feature customization, allowing vigilant management of program features at runtime to prevent violation of privacy and security policies. At the heart of this technique is the selective placement of checker functions(known as gates) into feature-constituent functions that need to be protected. Through execution gating and feature validation on the fly, DamGate provides differentiated control policy for program features and enables flexible runtime reconfiguration. The proposed framework is prototyped and evaluated using LibreOffice, a large-scale office suit. The evaluation results show that it can achieve desired feature customization with negligible gating overhead.},

Accordingly, web application vulnerabilities are useful subjects for empirical security research.

We describe BugBox, a corpus and exploit simulation environment for PHP web application vulnerabilities. BugBox provides a test environment and a packaging mechanism that allows for the distribution and sharing of vulnerability data. The goal is to facilitate empirical vulnerability studies, security tool evaluation, and security metrics research. In addition, the framework promotes developer education by demonstrating exploits and providing a sandbox where they can be run safely. BugBox and its modules are open source and available online, and new modules may be contributed by community members.},

	abstract     = {Modern web browsers have accrued an incredibly broad set of features since being invented for hypermedia dissemination in 1990. Many of these features benefit users by enabling new types of web applications. However, some features also bring risk to users' privacy and security, whether through implementation error, unexpected composition, or unintended use. Currently there is no general methodology for weighing these costs and benefits. Restricting access to only the features which are necessary for delivering desired functionality on a given website would allow users to enforce the principle of lease privilege on use of the myriad APIs present in the modern web browser. However, security benefits gained by increasing restrictions must be balanced against the risk of breaking existing websites. This work addresses this problem with a methodology for weighing the costs and benefits of giving websites default access to each browser feature. We model the benefit as the number of websites that require the feature for some user-visible benefit, and the cost as the number of CVEs, lines of code, and academic attacks related to the functionality. We then apply this methodology to 74 Web API standards implemented in modern browsers. We find that allowing websites default access to large parts of the Web API poses significant security and privacy risks, with little corresponding benefit. We also introduce a configurable browser extension that allows users to selectively restrict access to low-benefit, high-risk features on a per site basis. We evaluated our extension with two hardened browser configurations, and found that blocking 15 of the 74 standards avoids 52.0{\%} of code paths related to previous CVEs, and 50.0{\%} of implementation code identified by our metric, without affecting the functionality of 94.7{\%} of measured websites.},

	abstract     = {For over two decades, timing attacks have been an active area of research within applied cryptography. These attacks exploit cryptosystem or protocol implementations that do not run in constant time. When implementing an elliptic curve cryptosystem with a goal to provide side-channel resistance, the scalar multiplication routine is a critical component. In such instances, one attractive method often suggested in the literature is Montgomery's ladder that performs a fixed sequence of curve and field operations. This paper describes a timing attack vulnerability in OpenSSL's ladder implementation for curves over binary fields. We use this vulnerability to steal the private key of a TLS server where the server authenticates with ECDSA signatures. Using the timing of the exchanged messages, the messages themselves, and the signatures, we mount a lattice attack that recovers the private key. Finally, we describe and implement an effective countermeasure.}
